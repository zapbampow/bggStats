# How to Use BGG Play Stats

At it's heart this tool is designed to allow you to drill down to get the information you want. There are 2 ways to drill down.

First, you can use the charts by clicking on the items in them. When you click on a bar or pie piece, then it adds a filter and updates the information.

Second, you can manually add filters through the dropdowns. There are more filter options than the charts give you.

Whenever you take either of those actions all the data shown should update.

## Syncing with BGG Data

The first time you enter your username the app will get your entire play data history. On subsequent visits, it will get all the newest play data automatically.

_Note:_ The app does NOT sync any changes you make to records that have already been downloaded.

**Example**

On Sunday you play a game and record it. On Monday you come to BGG Play Stats and see you didn't record the location of the game you played yesterday. You click the link to the BGG record and update the location. When you come back to BGG Plays Stats. The location will not be updated.

In order to see that change you will need to delete all data that is stored for your user and reload the page to trigger it to download your entire history again.

## The download process stalls

BoardGameGeek is amazingly generous to make so much of their data available for tools like this. In order to prevent abuse of their generosity, they limit the number of requests that can be made from apps like this. If you try to look at a bunch of users in quick succession, then your computer will be temporarily blocked and the download process will appear to be stalled.
